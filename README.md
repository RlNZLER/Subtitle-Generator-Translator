# Subtitle Generator and Translator

### 1\. Extract Audio from Video

You will need to extract the audio track from the video file. Common libraries that can help with this task include FFmpeg (which can be used directly or through a wrapper like `ffmpeg-python`).

### 2\. Transcribe Audio

For transcribing audio to text, you can use speech recognition APIs like Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, IBM Watson Speech to Text, or open-source alternatives like Mozilla's DeepSpeech. These tools can handle large vocabularies and different accents.

### 3\. Detect Language

To automatically detect the language of the spoken audio, you could use libraries such as `langdetect` or services like Google Cloud Translation API which also provide language detection capabilities.

### 4\. Voice Recognition and ID Assignment

For identifying different speakers in the audio, look into speaker diarization technologies. Libraries like pyAudioAnalysis or commercial APIs like those provided by Google or IBM can differentiate between speakers and assign unique IDs.

### 5\. Translation (if necessary)

If the original language isn't English, you'll need to translate the text. Google Translate API or Microsoft Translator Text API are robust options for this task.

### 6\. Create Subtitle File

To generate the .srt file, which includes time stamps and text, you can use a simple Python script. You would parse the timing information from the transcription and format it into the SRT file format.

### 7\. Multilingual Subtitles

-   Original Language: The direct transcription.
-   Phonetic (Transliteration): Convert the original language text into Latin script. Libraries like `unidecode` or specialized transliteration tools for specific languages (like Indic languages) might be required.
-   Translated to English: Use the translated texts from the previous step.

### 8\. Save and Sync Subtitles

The final step is to ensure the subtitles are correctly synced with the video and saved. Testing with different videos will be essential to refine this process.
