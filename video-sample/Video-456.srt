1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
You think I left because I stopped caring, that I was looking for excuses to go.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,540
You couldn't be more wrong, but that truth you'll never let yourself know,

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,900
because when you sit down to think about it, it all makes sense to you.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,380
Of course, I messed it up, the feeling seems like nothing new.

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,780
You write a list of all your failures, a list of changes to make,

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,240
a list of how you can't give love so it would be too wrong of you to take.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:29,180
But you're on my list of people to pray for, the list of people I wish to be well.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,780
You're the top of the damn list for people, of people for whom I easily found.

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,020
You sit down and it makes sense to you.

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,960
To be loved isn't something you choose, you think yourself undeserving of it,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,280
but to me, you're still a muse.

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,140
An aspiration to something better, a loud wish into the earth,

13
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,760
to be soulmates in every lifetime, even if you forgot.

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,440
In this one, for what it's worth.

15
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,060
You think that I left, but every part of me stays.

16
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,640
Anyways, you write a list of all your failures, you're successful to me anyways.

17
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,980
Despite your self-doubting, despite your damn list,

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,220
you've recorded every single one of your faults.

19
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,900
I write poetry to convince you that your beauty still exists.

20
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,620
But love is not mutual destruction.

21
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,980
Love cannot change your mind.

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,020
I think you're heaven on earth.

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,920
You think I'm somebody else's to find.

24
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,940
I say you're the winning lottery ticket.

25
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,820
You say you're just a rusted penny on the floor.

26
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,240
I say I've never seen you that way.

27
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,560
So you say you never want to see me again anymore.

28
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,420
Sometimes.

29
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,460
Some days.

30
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,060
Some months in between.

31
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,820
Then I get a text message that I pretend not to have seen.

32
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:46,040
You know, there's a mailbox in my mind replaying voicemails I never sent

33
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,300
with an infinite amount of storage full of words you thought I never meant.

34
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:58,260
from my new book, A Magnificently Ordinary Romance, available in bookstores and online now.
